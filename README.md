Hello-Git
=========

Hello-Git is a project simply to ~~play~~ learn GitHub:

	$learn = TRUE

	while ($learn == TRUE)
	{
		echo 'Keep learning!';
		$learn = TRUE;	// just to make sure!
	} else
	{
		echo 'you must be dead, sorry :(';
	}
	// THIS IS NOT A REAL SCRIPT, AND I HIGHLY DOUBT IT WILL WORK :).
